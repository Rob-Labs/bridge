# Bridge Contract and Backend

After completing the tests we have added a fee for swaps to the Bridge.sol contract and removed lock/unlock functions from imported Ownable.sol in the bigCoin.sol contract, which change no security changes from the test result

We attached test results file and txs list (result.md) on mainnet bsc to eth and back.
